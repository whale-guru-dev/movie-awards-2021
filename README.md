## About 

Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.

With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run `yarn && yarn dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/whale-guru-dev/movie-awards-2021.git
    yarn
    yarn dev
